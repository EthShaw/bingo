This website uses a simple but very helpful [library](thirdparty/base64-typedarrays.js) by
[Egor Nepomnyaschih](https://github.com/enepomnyaschih) to
convert TypedArrays to base64 and back. The library is available
on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/byte-base64) and its source
is available at its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/enepomnyaschih/byte-base64).
Thanks to Egor Nepomnyaschih for providing this library, it has been very helpful.
