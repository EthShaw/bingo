# Thirdparty Libraries
Thirdparty libraries are licensed under their own licenses from their authors,

thirdparty libraries (located in the [thirdparty](thirdparty) directory):
- This website uses a simple but very helpful
  [library](thirdparty/base64-typedarrays.js) by
  [Egor Nepomnyaschih](https://github.com/enepomnyaschih) to convert
  TypedArrays to base64 and back. The library is available on
  [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/byte-base64) and its source is available
  at its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/enepomnyaschih/byte-base64).
  Thanks to Egor Nepomnyaschih for providing this library, it has been very
  helpful.

  found at its GitHub repository

  the authors of normalize.css for providing this library.
