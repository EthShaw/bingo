        Welcome to the free online Bingo card generator. I made this generator
        because (from my very, very brief research) it seemed like there was a
        lack of free online (easily-findable) bingo card generators, and I had
        free time. I specify that it is a "free" online bingo card generator
        because I think a lot of times people search for stuff that is "free"
        and generally the stuff that is labeled as "free" is not actually that
        free, so I thought I'd try to add something to the search results that
        is actually free and is labeled as free.

        When you generate a bingo card, all the data of the card is stored in its
        URL, so your bingo card will never expire as long as this website exists.
        The data is not stored anywhere except on your browser and in the URL,
        so it does not cost me anything, and therefore should not cost you anything
        either!
