        Welcome to my free online Bingo card generator. It's not perfect, but
        for anyone that finds it, I hope it's useful.
        <a href="https://github.com/FishDog5000/bingo">
            The source code is available on GitHub.
        </a>

    <p>
        When you generate a bingo card, all the data of the card is stored in
        its URL, so your bingo card will never expire as long as this website
        exists. We currently only support 75 ball bingo. The bingo cards are
        easily printable using the button on each card's page. Printing a full
        card set together is not currently implemented but will be in the
        future along with the ability to adjust the print size.
        WARNING: this project is VERY Work In Progress at the moment. It is not
        guaranteed that any bingo cards created now will continue to work in
        the near future because the site is not yet complete.

    <!--
    TODO make a system where you can distribute one URL to everyone, and people can potentially get the same card,
    but it's easier because there's only one URL
