        Welcome to my free online Bingo card generator. It's not perfect, but
        for anyone that finds it, I hope it's useful.
        <a href="https://github.com/FishDog5000/bingo">
            The source code is available on GitHub.
        </a>

    <p>
        When you generate a bingo card, all the data of the card is stored in
        its URL, so your bingo card will never expire as long as this website
        exists. We currently only support 75 ball bingo. From my tests, your
        bingo cards should also be printable if you wish to print it out, but
        this is not currently guaranteed. WARNING: this project is VERY Work In
        Progress at the moment. It is not guaranteed that any bingo cards
        created now will continue to work in the near future because the site
        is not yet complete.

    <!--
    TODO make a system where you can distribute one URL to everyone, and people can potentially get the same card,
    but it's easier because there's only one URL
