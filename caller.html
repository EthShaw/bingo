        Welcome to the free online Bingo card generator. I made this generator
        because (from my very, very brief research) it seemed like there was a
        lack of free online (easily-findable) bingo card generators, and I had
        free time. When I say "free," I mean that it doesn't cost anything, no
        matter how many bingo cards you want to generate, not that it's free
        for a certain amount and then charges for more. It's not perfect, but
        for anyone that finds it, I hope it's useful.

    <p>
        When you generate a bingo card, all the data of the card is stored in
        its URL, so your bingo card will never expire as long as this website
        exists. We currently only support 75 ball bingo. In theory (and from my
        tests), your bingo cards should also be printable if you wish to print
        it out, but this is not currently guaranteed. This project is very Work
        In Progress at the moment.
